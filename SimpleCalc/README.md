# SimpleCalc

This is the simplest example of an expression evaluator in the **kaminpy** repository.

**SimpleCalc** is implemented in three functions:

* `tokenize`: to split the input into meaningful tokens for parsing;
* `evaluate`: recursive parser and evaluator;
* `repl`: interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop.

To keep the control flow as readable as possible, there is no error checking.

The Jupyter Notebook has the same code, minus the tests.
